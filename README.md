<h1 align='center'>Simulated Time</h1>

<p align="center">A testing (and partial) replacement for Python's <code>time</code> package, for fully-controlled time-dependent tests.</p>

<br /><br />

Testing functions that depend on time is always tricky, and can take long. To save time and avoid relying on `time.sleep()`, this package allows to fast-forward time arbitrarily.

It implements the functions `time.time()` and `time.monotonic()`.
